# Sorting-Products-Bayes-and-Sorting-Reviews-WLB-

## Sorting Products

Bayesian average score calculates a probabilistic weighted average based on the score distributions.

For example, let's say two people rated a product with an average of 5, and another product was rated by 40 people with an average of 4.6.

Which one is more meaningful, and which product should rank higher in the rating?

In this project, we will examine the social proof effect through a ranking of scores calculated using the Bayes score.

Social proof is a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in choosing how to behave in a given situation
